1. Design & Persist Data Model
Pick an ORM & Database

Use SQLAlchemy (async) or Tortoise ORM with PostgreSQL.

Install drivers (asyncpg for SQLAlchemy).

Define Your Schemas

Users (id, username, email, hashed_password, spotify_token?)

Songs (id, title, artist, duration, spotify_uri?)

Playlists (id, name, user_id)

PlaylistSongs join table (playlist_id, song_id, order_index)

Migrations

Use Alembic (with SQLAlchemy) or Aerich (with Tortoise) to manage schema evolution.

2. Implement Authentication & Authorization
Registration & Login

Endpoints: POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login.

Passwords hashed with bcrypt (passlib).

Issue JWTs with python-jose.

Protect Your Routes

Create a get_current_user dependency that reads the Authorization: Bearer <token> header.

Apply Depends(get_current_user) to any endpoint that needs an authenticated user.

3. CRUD Endpoints for Core Resources
Songs

GET /songs (browse)

GET /songs/{id} (detail)

Playlists

GET /playlists (user’s lists)

POST /playlists (create)

GET /playlists/{id} (detail + tracks)

PUT /playlists/{id} (rename)

DELETE /playlists/{id}

Playlist Tracks

POST /playlists/{id}/tracks

Liked Songs

GET /me/liked

POST /me/liked/{song_id}

DELETE /me/liked/{song_id}

Use Pydantic models for request/response validation.

4. Spotify Web API Integration
OAuth Flow

Endpoint GET /auth/spotify → redirect to Spotify’s auth page.

Callback GET /auth/spotify/callback → exchange code for tokens, store in user record.

Import Playlists

Endpoint POST /spotify/import

Use spotipy or raw HTTP to fetch user’s Spotify playlists & tracks, then upsert into your DB.

Keep Tokens Fresh

Store refresh_token, implement token-refresh logic in a background task or on-demand.

5. Smart Shuffle Service
Algorithm Design

Pre-shuffle the list once per session & cache it (Redis?)

Track “played” indexes, cycle through until exhausted

Optionally generate multiple “sets” ahead of time to avoid repeats

Endpoints

GET /playlists/{id}/shuffle/next → returns the next track

6. Testing, Validation & Documentation
Automated Tests

Unit tests for services (shuffle logic, Spotify integration) using pytest.

Integration tests for endpoints using httpx.AsyncClient.

API Docs

FastAPI auto-docs at /docs and /redoc—add descriptions, example payloads.

Data Validation

Use Pydantic’s Field(..., regex=…), conint(), etc., to guard against bad data.

7. Optimization & Scaling
Caching

Cache frequent reads (e.g., playlist metadata) in Redis.

Background Tasks

Offload heavy Spotify imports to FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks or a Celery worker.

Rate Limiting

Protect your API from abuse (e.g., via slowapi or API Gateway).

8. Dockerization & Deployment
Dockerfiles for both backend/ and (later) frontend/.

Compose a docker-compose.yml bringing up:

FastAPI app

Postgres

Redis (optional)

CI/CD pipeline:

Run tests

Build Docker images

Deploy to AWS ECS / DigitalOcean App Platform / Railway / Render

9. Monitoring & Observability
Logging: structured JSON logs (via uvicorn/loguru).

Metrics: instrument with Prometheus + Grafana or a SaaS (e.g., Datadog).

Error Tracking: Sentry or similar.

10. Iterate & Extend
Add user-generated content (e.g., comments or collaborative playlists).

Real-time features (WebSockets for live listening parties).

Mobile SDK / GraphQL API.

Analytics (last-played timestamps, popular songs, etc.).
